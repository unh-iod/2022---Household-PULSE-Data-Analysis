1. Read data folders
2. Clean and prepare data
2.1 Merge data and wieghts
2.2 Clean data and create new variables - independent variables

# 1. Read Data

```{r}
#initialize empty data list
raw_data <- data.frame()
raw_weights <- data.frame()

#iterate through data folder to pull in each week
for (i in 1:(length(list.dirs('./Data'))-1)){
  dir = list.dirs('./Data')[i+1]
  if ((i+27)<41) {
    raw_data = dplyr::bind_rows(raw_data,read.csv(paste(dir,'/pulse2021_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep='')))
    print(paste(dir,'/pulse2021_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep=''))
    raw_weights = dplyr::bind_rows(raw_weights,read.csv(paste(dir,'/pulse2021_repwgt_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep='')))
  }
  else {
    raw_data = dplyr::bind_rows(raw_data,read.csv(paste(dir,'/pulse2022_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep='')))
    print(paste(dir,'/pulse2022_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep=''))
    raw_weights = dplyr::bind_rows(raw_weights,read.csv(paste(dir,'/pulse2022_repwgt_puf_',i+27,'.csv',sep='')))
  }
}

#save.image()
```

# 2. Clean and prepare data

```{r}
#Year 2021 for weeks 28-40, otherwise 2022
df <- raw_data %>% 
  mutate(yr = ifelse(WEEK < 41,2021,2022))
```

## 2.1 Merge data and wieghts

```{r}
df_joined <- df %>%
  inner_join(raw_weights, by = c('SCRAM','WEEK'))
```

## 2.2 Keep only variables needed

```{r}
df_selected <- df_joined %>%
  select(## UNIQUE ID ##
         SCRAM,
         ## RESPONSE WEEK ##
         WEEK,

         ## DISABILITY ##
         SEEING,
